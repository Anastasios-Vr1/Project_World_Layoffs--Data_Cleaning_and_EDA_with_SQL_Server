# Introduction
### Overview
This project focuses on analyzing global layoffs data in two parts: data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, and after an initial data cleaning phase, which involved removing duplicates, fixing format issues, and handling missing values, the cleaned data was used for analysis. The exploratory data analysis uncovered key trends and insights, such as industry-specific layoffs, company-wise impacts, and geographical distribution of layoffs. Detailed steps for each part of the project are covered later in the readme.

### Data Source
Layoffs Dataset: This dataset includes information on layoffs across multiple industries, although many companies operate with a tech-driven focus. The data provides details such as company name, location, number of employees laid off, and the percentage of workforce affected. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle to explore global layoffs amid economic slowdowns. [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022)

### Tools Used
SQL Server: Utilized for data cleaning, transformations, and conducting exploratory data analysis.
This project delves into global layoffs data, utilizing SQL Server for comprehensive data cleaning and exploratory data analysis. It features queries for managing, analyzing, and visualizing layoffs trends across different industries and years, providing valuable insights into workforce reductions.
