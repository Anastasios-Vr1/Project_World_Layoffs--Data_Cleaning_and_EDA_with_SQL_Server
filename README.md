# Introduction
### Overview
üìäThis project focuses on analyzing global layoffs data in two parts: data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, and after an initial data cleaning phase, which involved removing duplicates, fixing format issues, and handling missing values, the cleaned data was used for analysis. The exploratory data analysis uncovered key trends and insights, such as industry-specific layoffs, company-wise impacts, and geographical distribution of layoffs. Detailed steps for each part of the project are covered later in the readme.

### Data Source
Layoffs Dataset: This dataset includes information on layoffs across multiple industries, although many companies operate with a tech-driven focus. The data provides details such as company name, location, number of employees laid off, and the percentage of workforce affected. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle to explore global layoffs amid economic slowdowns. [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022)üóÉÔ∏è

### Tools Used
SQL Server: Utilized for data cleaning, transformations, and conducting exploratory data analysis.

# Part 1: Data Cleaning üßº

### Objective
- **Goal**: Ensure data accuracy and consistency for meaningful analysis by removing duplicates, handling null values, and standardizing key columns
- **Focus**: Remove duplicates, handle null values, and standardize key columns.
  
### Steps Taken

#### 1.1 Creating the Staging Table
A staging table (layoffs_staging) was created to preserve the original data and safely perform data cleaning operations.
The layoffs_staging table replicates the structure of the original dbo.layoffs table, and all data was copied into it for processing.

```sql
SELECT * 
INTO layoffs_staging
FROM dbo.layoffs

```

#### 1.2 Removing Duplicates
- Used `ROW_NUMBER()` to identify duplicate rows based on key columns such as company, location, industry, total laid off, and other fields
- Deleted all duplicate rows, keeping only the first occurrence for each group.

```sql
WITH cte_duplicates AS (
  SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY
                                  company,
                                  location,
                                  industry,
                                  total_laid_off,
                                  percentage_laid_off,
                                  date,
                                  stage,
                                  country,
                                  funds_raised_millions
                          ORDER BY company ASC) AS row_num
  FROM dbo.layoffs_staging
)
DELETE FROM cte_duplicates
WHERE row_num > 1
```

#### 1.3 Standardizing Data and Converting Data Types
- **Trimming spaces**: Cleaned unnecessary spaces in the `company` column
- **Standardizing industry names**: Fixed inconsistent naming for industry categories like "Crypto" and "Crypto Currency"
- **Correcting location names**: Updated non-standard location names (e.g., "Dusseldorf" to "D√ºsseldorf")
- **Converting `date` column**: Converted `date` from `varchar` to `DATE` type after cleaning invalid date entries.

```sql
UPDATE dbo.layoffs_staging
SET company = TRIM(company)

UPDATE dbo.layoffs_staging
SET industry = 'Crypto'
WHERE industry LIKE 'Crypto%'

ALTER TABLE dbo.layoffs_staging
ALTER COLUMN date DATE
```

#### 1.4 Handling Null Values
- Identified rows with `NULL` or blank values in key columns like `industry`
- Used a self-join to populate missing `industry` values from matching rows.

```sql
UPDATE t2
SET t2.industry = t1.industry
FROM dbo.layoffs_staging t2
JOIN dbo.layoffs_staging t1 ON t2.company = t1.company AND t2.location = t1.location
WHERE t2.industry IS NULL
AND t1.industry IS NOT NULL
```

#### 1.5 Removing Useless Rows and Columns üßπüóëÔ∏è
- Removed rows where both `total_laid_off` and `percentage_laid_off` were marked as `NULL`
- Dropped unnecessary columns after cleaning.

```sql
DELETE FROM dbo.layoffs_staging
WHERE total_laid_off = 'NULL'
AND percentage_laid_off = 'NULL'

ALTER TABLE dbo.layoffs_staging
DROP COLUMN row_num
```

# Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) üîç

### Objective
- Analyze the cleaned data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights across industries, companies, and geographical locations affected by layoffs.

### Key Insightsüí°

#### 2.1 Highest Number of Layoffs in a Single Day
- The **highest number of layoffs on a single day** was 12,000.

GROUP BY 
	location
ORDER BY 2 DESC

```

#### 2.4 Layoffs by Country
- The **United States leads** with 256,559 layoffs, far surpassing other countries like India (35,993).
- The top five countries are rounded out by the Netherlands, Sweden, and Brazil.

```

#### 2.5 Layoffs by Year
- 2022 had the **highest number of layoffs** at 160,661, with 2023 already showing 125,677 layoffs (with only 3 months of data).
- The year 2020 saw 80,998 layoffs, likely due to the early pandemic impact, while 2021 had a sharp decrease (15,823), indicating some recovery.

```sql
SELECT
	YEAR(date) AS year, 
	SUM(total_laid_off) AS total_laid_off

```

#### 2.6 Layoffs by Industry
- **Consumer and Retail sectors** lead the layoffs with over 45,000 and 43,000 job cuts, respectively.
- Other notable sectors include **Transportation** (15,227 layoffs in 2022) and **Finance**.
- Specialized sectors like **Legal**, **Energy**, and **Aerospace** experienced fewer layoffs, reflecting their resilience or smaller workforce.

```sql
SELECT

	SUM(total_laid_off) AS total_laid_off
FROM
	dbo.layoffs_staging
GROUP BY
	industry
ORDER BY

GROUP BY
	stage
ORDER BY
	cnt DESC
```

#### 2.8 Layoffs per Month
- **January** stands out with the highest number of layoffs (92,037), followed by **November** (55,758), likely due to seasonal adjustments or year-end restructuring efforts.

```sql
SELECT
	MONTH(date) AS Months,
	SUM(total_laid_off) AS total_laid_off

# 3. Conclusions üñãÔ∏è

### Insights 
From the analysis of global layoffs data, several key trends and insights emerged:

1. **Tech Industry Dominance**: U.S. tech giants, such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, led the layoffs in both 2022 and 2023, reflecting significant post-pandemic adjustments.
2. **Geographical Impact**: The U.S. saw the highest number of layoffs, with the SF Bay Area, Seattle, and NYC being the most affected cities. Global hotspots include India, the Netherlands, and Sweden.
3. **Sector-Specific Layoffs**: Consumer and Retail sectors were hit hardest, while specialized industries like Legal, Energy, and Aerospace experienced minimal reductions.
4. **Pandemic-Driven Layoffs**: Travel and hospitality companies, such as Uber and Booking.com, faced major layoffs in 2020 due to COVID-19, while other sectors showed more resilience.
5. **Emerging Trends**: Increased layoffs in 2023 in sectors like Hardware and Marketing reflect ongoing market shifts and cost-cutting efforts.

### Final Remarks 
This project provided valuable insights into global layoffs trends, highlighting the sectors and regions most affected by workforce reductions. By leveraging SQL Server for both data cleaning and exploratory data analysis, the analysis uncovered trends that reflect economic shifts and industry-specific challenges.

The conclusions drawn from this project offer actionable insights into the industries most impacted by the economic slowdown. As the dataset continues to grow, there may be further opportunities to analyze additional trends, particularly with visualizations or deeper sector-specific analyses.
